Dynamic scheduling problem is a more complex NP-hard problem compared with static scheduling problem and in most cases it has multi-objective performance criteria.
Based on study of the multi-objective dynamic scheduling problem, it employs the rolling-horizon procedure and an improved genetic algorithm.
In the rolling-horizon procedure, dynamic scheduling problem is decomposed into a series of continual and static scheduling problems, multi-objective genetic algorithm is applied to each of these problems.
In order to adapt to the complex manufacturing environment and sustain the stability of production, a human-compute collaborative scheduling procedure is presented for the implementation of the scheduling process.
A scheduling prototype system is developed and tested on the improved job-shop benchmark instance, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.
