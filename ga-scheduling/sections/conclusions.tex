\section{Conclusions}
This paper studies the multi-objective job shop scheduling problems in dynamic manufacturing environments by fully utilizing the static scheduling capabilities of algorithms in the literature.
We propse a rolling horizon rescheduling strategy based on an improved genetic algorithm to tackle stochastic events, including unexpected events, urgent job arrivals and continuous arrival of planned jobs.
The proposed genetic algorithm is able to conduct online optimization within each rescheduling horizon and make the rolling horizon startegy adaptable to complex dynamic scheduling environment changes.
A prototype dynamic scheduling system is developed based on the rolling horizon rescheduling strategy and comptuational experiments validated its feasibility and effectiveness.
