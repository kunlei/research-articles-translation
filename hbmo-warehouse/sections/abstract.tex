\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a mathematical model for the warehouse facility location problem in a rail transit network.
A bee colony optimization algorithm is developed to identify the optimal number of warehouse facilities as well as their corresponding locations.
Problem-specific encoding scheme and crossover operator are designed to facilitate adaption of the algorithm.
In addition, a local search algorithm is developed to improve the algorithm's capability in searching for global optimal solutions.
