\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a mathematical model for the warehouse facility location problem in a rail transit network.
A bee colony optimization algorithm is developed to identify the optimal number of warehouses as well as their locations.
Problem-specific encoding scheme and crossover operator are designed to facilitate adaption of the algorithm.
In addition, local search algorithm is developed to improve the algorithm's capability in searching for the global optimal solutions.
