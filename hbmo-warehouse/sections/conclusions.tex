\section{Conclusions}
This paper proposes a warehouse facility location model in a rail transit system and a bee colony optimization algorithm is applied to identify both the best number of warehouses and their corresponding locations.
Problem-specific encoding scheme, crossover operator and various local search algorithms  are designed to improve the searching efficiency of the algorithm.
In future research, it is worthwhile to consider construction cycle and urban planing in the analysis and conduct multiple rounds of the optimization exercise in order to obtain global optimal solutions.
