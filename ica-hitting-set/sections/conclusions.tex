\section{Conclusions}
The minimal hitting set problem has many real-world engineering applications but is computationally challenging to solve.
This paper proposes an modified colonial competitive algorithm to solve this combinatorial optimization problem and elaborates the detailed algorithmic steps.
Performance of the proposed algorithm is validated on testing instances and minimal hitting sets are obtained for most instances with reasonable times.
Extensive comparisons are made during the computation process in order to get distinct minimal hitting sets, which slows down the solution process.
Finally, the proposed algorithm is used to solve the minimal hitting set problem of equipment selection in a manufacturing system to further demonstrate its effectiveness.
