\section{Conclusions}
The minimal hitting set problem has many real-world applications but is computationally hard to solve.
This paper proposed an modified colonial competitive algorithm to solve this combinatorial optimization problem and elaborated the detailed steps.
Performance of the proposed algorithm is validated on testing instances and minimal hitting sets are obtained for most instances with reasonable times.
Lots of comparisons are made during the computation process in order to get distinct minimal hitting sets, which slows down the solution process.
Finally, the minimal hitting set problem is applied to the equipment selection problem in a manufacturing system.
