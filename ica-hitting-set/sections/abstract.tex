A CCA was developed and modified to solve the problem of minimal candidates set.
The minimal candidate set was a minimal hitting set.
The modified CCA improved performance in initialization, assimilation and rebirth of original CCA by introducing a third type of country, independent country, to the population of countries maintained by CCA by introducing a third type of country, independent country, to the population of countries maintained by CCA.
Implementation details of the proposed CCA and modified colonial competitive algorithm (MCCA) were elaborated using an illustrative example.
The performance of the algorithms was analyzed, and the results by the MCCA were compared with DMDSE-Tree algorithm.
When 90\% of the minimal hitting sets are obtained, the MCCA has better efficiency.
Finally, the experimental results of certain system verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, which proves that this method can be applied in solving the minimal hitting set of combinatorial optimization problems for selection of equipment effectively.
