This paper proposes a modified colonial competitive algorithm (CCA) to solve the minimal hitting set problem and demonstrates its effectiveness in tackling the equipment selection problem encountered in a manufacturing company.
The proposed algorithm introduces a new country type, namely, independent country, to the existing colonial competitive algorithm framework, and, as a result, it differs from the classical algorithm in a number of key algorithmic steps, including empire initialization, assimilation and updating within empire.
Implementation details of the modified colonial competitive algorithm (MCCA) are elaborated using an illustrative example.
The performance of the MCCA is analyzed and compared with that of DMDSE-Tree algorithm, which shows that MCCA is able to obtain 90\% minimal hitting sets on benchmark instance with better efficiency.
A equipment selection problem is used to further validate MCCA's performance and computational results demonstrate its effectiveness in solving the minimal hitting set problem effectively and efficiently.
