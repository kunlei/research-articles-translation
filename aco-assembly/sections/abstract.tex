An adaptive ant colony optimization was proposed to solve the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP).
According to the characteristics of the ALBP, a method of solution constructing strategy was developed, and a better differentiation of objective function was proposed to appraisal solution quality.
However, general ant algorithm often falls into local optimal and consume excessive time, in order to overcome these shortcoming, an improved ACO was presented by adaptive adjustment of the parameters in the algorithm, which has a good ability of searching better solution at higher convergence speed.
Finally, the proposed algorithm was tested and compared against best known algorithms reported in the literatures, and the experimental results indicate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
