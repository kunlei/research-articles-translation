\begin{abstract}
An adaptive ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP).
Considering the characteristics of the ALBP, a feasible solution construction strategy as well as an improved objective function that performs superior to traditional methods in evaluating solution quality are developed.
In addition, the improved algorithm utilizes a strategy to adaptively adjust algorithmic parameters, including pheromone evaporation rate, to address the issue of getting stuck in local optima and slow convergence rate that are often observed in traditional ant colony optimization algorithms.
Finally, performance of the proposed algorithms is validated against state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmarking instances, and experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
