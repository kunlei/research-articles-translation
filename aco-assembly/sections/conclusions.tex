\section{Conclusions}
This paper proposes an adaptive ACO algorithm for the assembly line balancing problem.
It encompasses the following characteristics: comprehensive considerations of three rules of utilization, exploration and random search to construct feasible assignment plans; comprehensive considerations of assembly line balancing rate as well as smoothing factor to evaluate balancing performance to increase differentiation capability of different solutions; adaptive modifications of global pheromone evaporation factor in the construction phase to help the algorithm jump out of local optima and improve its global search capability. 
Computational results validate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.

This paper only considers single deterministic assembly balancing problem and the proposed algorithm can be used to solve more complex assembly balancing problems, like dynamic problem, stochastic problem, multi-objective problem and multi-model assembly line balancing problems.
